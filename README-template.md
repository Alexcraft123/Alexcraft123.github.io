# HOW I MADE THIS PROJECT

# # Step 1:

I wrote in the code all the elements separating them by differents DIV's. The DIV's were one for the main title and the second title, another one with just the description and the other one with all the buttons. All of this DIV's are inside of a main DIV that all of them share, so we can modify the background, just as it appears on the example.

# # Step 2:

I established a different class for all differents DIV's so I can set different settings based on each individual DIV. Then I set the classes on the CSS file.

# # Step 3:

Once I wrote the classes on the CSS file, I established the styles of each DIV so it can look just as it looks at the example.
